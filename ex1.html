    <article>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
         industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
         text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
          of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
           survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
           typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
           the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
            containing Lorem Ipsum 
           passages, and more recently with desktop 
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
         versions of Lorem Ipsum</article>
